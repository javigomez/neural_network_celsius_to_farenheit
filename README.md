# neural_network_celsius_to_farenheit
Simple neural network that converts Celsius to Farenheit. The cool part is that you don't code the formula, you just give a few cases and the neural network finds the formula on itself. See: https://github.com/javigomez/neural_network_celsius_to_farenheit/blob/main/notebook.ipynb
